                  Artificial Intelligence, also commonly referred to as AI in mainstream media. In 1956, Dartmouth Conference coined the term Artificial Intelligence as a duplication to human reasoning through computers. Gaining global popularity with the rise of generative AI in the early twenty first century. Neural Language Processing (NPL) teaches computer to process data sets in a similar fashion to the human brain. Most computers are able to recognize slang, handwriting, images, base-level emotions, and colors. Large Language Models are rooted in deeper learning structures called transfer networks. Apart of NPL, data sets based in AI that are typically trained on massive amounts of text/visual data to generate human language responses. The larger the data set thee more the computer is able to processing understand in the context of the human brain. AI models are historically based on focused in perception of the human brain.

               These language learning models allow models to read, write, code, and response in a human-like fashion in addition to being able to processing the user input. The data that is inputted into these AI machines essentially train them. As I spoke about in my previous paper, teachable machine processes reflected in AI thrive off of human interaction and input. The more data, the more diverse the output will be. Although they absorb the information that they are fed, chat bots should not be able to tell people how to build chemical weaponry, exhibit racism and or sexism, and any kind of dis or misinformation. Disinformation is information that has a foundation built on nothing and it is typically bias in another belief. Misinformation is built off of an argument and contradicts the speaker in some way. AIâ€™s built on one or the other can become bias quickly and ultimately are useless to society.
