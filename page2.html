           Facial recognition is a critical part of day-to-day life whether it be directly related to the FaceID that Apple uses to open their devices or facial recognition that the FBI uses to identify suspects. The software that is able to distinctly identify features of the human face,  Harry Henderson’s article Facial Recognition from the Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology addresses the algorithm used to identify landmarks on the human face. Landmarks that are then analyzed “geometrically and statistically” to databases. By placing these things in databases, they can be generalized so that when the software is being used, it does not become a basis against one facial structure. The ominous feature of facial recognition is that it is able to analyze features specific to the person it is looking at based on a database of generalizations. Cameras also used facial recognition to set brightness, exposure, and focus which is why cell phones have a difficult time focusing on things that are not the human face. Thermal cameras are used to identify the obstructing features of the human face such as glasses of makeup. The heat emitted from the image can ignore the obstructions. Image processing is an extensive part of the facial recognition process because of the cross database analysis. 
	While Henderson explains the logistics of facial recognition, the article also recognizes the disadvantages such as risks to the privacy of the user, and the personal data that is being collected. The article also identifies the strides that are being made in the field, including emotional identification and color recognition.

	Kyle Kirkland’s Computer Vision—Creating Machines That Can See describes the key parts of the human face as “nodal points' ' and the average face has about 80 of them. However, only about 15-20 of those features can actually define one human face from another. Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) has been run on facial recognition software since 2000, and even The Department Of Homeland Security uses this to identify and organize the national database to protect US Citizens against terrorist attacks. Kirlkand also explains that since emotions cannot be directly detected through facial recognition devices, maybe countries will not allow applicants of passports or driver's licenses to shed a smile of any kind. 
	Kirkland also raises concerns similar to the concerns of Henderson in the previous article by mentioning the security and privacy of user data. Averaging images together will allow for a more diverse database. However, it dilutes every single image-- meaning that one  person will never fit the average blueprint of facial recognition. The idea of the blueprint is critical to the complexity of the software, as the faster image processing become the faster the computer is able to differentiate one thing from another. Kirlkand mentions his nodal points, saying that there must be 15-20 points on a human face to make it unique. The more data in these bases will allow for people with significantly more distinct features to be identified more easily compared to those who are more similar to the blueprint. In the conclusion of his paper, Kirkland addresses “electroencephalography” , a technique that allows the human brain to spot something interesting and alert the computer of the discovery. The human mind can scan a large number of images from the computer and develop a personal database just based on this technique.

	In conclusion, facial recognition, while a huge part of society, can pose some personal data risks as they compile every single face they encounter within a specific program. Using these software to our advantage is critical. Important things such as nodal points are what makes the human face unique to itself. Geometrical and statistical analysis is what drives programs to identify the nuances in human beings, along with thermal processing which allows for diversity in the databases.
