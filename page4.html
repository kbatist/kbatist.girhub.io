                  Feminist Data Visualization deals with diversifying the data that our technologies collect over time and how we can diversify the software developers and UX designers that curate these apps and technologies. Starting at the beginning, teachable machines are web interfaces that  allow the user to interact with the models without coding or having any prior knowledge of the machine. These machines transfer their data into a program to find patterns and trends within sound and image samples given to them by the user. Teachable machines are able to recognize classes based on images, creating a more niche program that can identify the underlying traits from the user's input and data. This is a simpler way to collect data without having to code huge models that require complex data analysis and coding background. However, machine learning comes with bias in gender, and physical appearance depending on the maker. Feminist data visualization is very important in this context because data visualization is rooted in the way that humans interact with computers.

                  Data visualization focuses on the keywords that are employed to deal with the humanities of how knowledge is transmitted into data analysis. The evolution of feminist theory in data has impacted the way that machine learning is viewed by those in the humanities. Majorly dealing with the ideas of how identity is constructed and or perceived by machines. The new goal of feminist data visualization is to expose the assumption made in the choice of teachable machines as well as what the intended audience is for the model. Companies are looking to marginalized communities to identify the design and user experience in order to diversify their products. It also allows them to analyze what kind of knowledge is being excluded from the current knowledge of teachable machines. Critical visualization is a term that was coined by Peter Hall in 2008, meaning the technological view of data analysis. Focusing on how power is used and distributed during the design process as well as how we can add more voices to the design process in order to push the feminist idea that data must be more diverse to make it more reliable.

            Why Data Visualization? What does this provide for students? 
               <br> 
               Allowing students to visualize their own data, as well as analyze patterns in their habits. Visualization is important in all levels of learning. Although it seems juvenile- it can actually give us a new perspective on the data set.
